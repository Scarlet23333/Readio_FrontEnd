üìö Reading Companion ‚Äî Audio-First Edition (Unified Concept)
1.1 Smart Book Discovery
Personalized search & AI-powered recommendations:


Users input preferences‚Äîgenres, moods, favorite authors, reading goals.


The system also analyzes trending topics or user behavior (browse history, ratings).


Applies hybrid recommender algorithms (collaborative‚ÄØ+‚ÄØcontent-based filtering + LLM-powered reasoning) to uncover both mainstream and hidden gems psychologytoday.com+3reddit.com+3trendhunter.com+3en.wikipedia.org+13medium.com+13huntscreens.com+13en.wikipedia.org.


Pulls data from platforms like Qloo, The Hawaii Project, StoryGraph, and emerging players to enrich discovery en.wikipedia.org+2en.wikipedia.org+2en.wikipedia.org+2.


1.2 Bite-Sized Audio Summaries
AI-generated, audio-first summaries that spark curiosity:


Condense key ideas into 3‚Äì5‚ÄØmin narrations.


Delivered via professional TTS voices, no video required.


Summaries optimized for on-the-go listening‚Äîperfect for commutes or micro-learning.


Builds on benefits of audiobooks in improving literacy, comprehension, empathy‚Äîespecially for children and elderly‚Äîwithout replacing full reading. Also makes reading a habit for most young adults who currently spend most time on short videos.


2. Tailored Audiobook Experiences
Voice personalization, not voice generation:


Offer curated voice options (e.g., ‚ÄúPlayful child voice‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalm senior voice‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfessional urban voice‚Äù).


Simplified UI controls let users choose voice styles, pacing, and emphasis via SSML.


No need for custom voice training‚Äîleveraging high-quality TTS engines (Murf, ElevenLabs, Play.ht, Amazon Polly) .
